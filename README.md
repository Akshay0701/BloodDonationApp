<b> Problem Statement: BloodDonation App </b>

The current system that is using by the blood bank is manual system. With the manual system, there are problems in managing the donors' records. The records of the donor might not be kept safely and there might be missing of donor's records due to human error or disasters

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>
<p> This is a open source blood Donation app available for Android smartphones. Inssen searches, notifies and connect thousands of blood donors in three simple steps. Inssen donation app ensures hassle free blood donation and privacy of a blood donor. A blood donor can select any specific date and location to donate blood and find a suitable person who needs blood. Connecting blood donors and needy reduces time which increases the possibility of saving lives and also eliminates the shortage of blood. <br></p>

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their route bus and track its location. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app : 
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different route busses we used the efficient recyclerview.
Google Maps API : We are also using the Google Maps API free version for  below 1000 users. In future if the user base increases we will go for the upgraded plan too.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the Bus driver's locations received from their mobile at real time and update it to local databases using Room. Coordinates are then updated in the bus route screen and students can track their route bus locations.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with GNITS institute with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [App](https://github.com/Akshay0701/BloodDonationApp/blob/master/blooddonation.apk).
Once the app is fully tested and functional in GNITS institute, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this transportation service. We aim that by next year most of the colleges in our district will use Bus tracking apps to check out their bus routes and be informed all the time. Also we are planning to include emergency SOS features for students traveling in busses if they are stuck somewhere
